# Learning Record for Introduction_to_Scripting_in_Python_Specialization on Coursera
This repository contains my learning record for the Introduction_to_Scripting_in_Python_Specialization course on Coursera. The course consists of four individual courses:
[Python Programming Essentials](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-programming)
[Python Data Representations](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-representation)
[Python Data Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-analysis)
[Python Data Visualization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-visualization)

I started recording my progress when I was about halfway through the course, so this repository only contains the records for Python_data_analysis and Python_visualization. It also includes my certificate. This repository is for learning purposes only, and you are welcome to refer to it, but please do not copy and paste directly. I wish everyone good luck in their learning!
